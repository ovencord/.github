Ovencord is a technical collective dedicated to building high-performance, 
Bun-native solutions for the Discord ecosystem. 

We believe that emulation is the enemy of performance. Our mission is to 
eliminate the legacy Node.js overhead from Discord tools, replacing it with 
pure, Zig-powered Bun native implementations.

#### Our Philosophy:
- **Native-First:** We don't just "support" Bun; we build FOR Bun.
- **Zero-Bloat:** If it's legacy and slow, it's gone.
- **Speed is a Feature:** We optimize for microseconds and megabytes.

**Join the evolution. Stop emulating, start running.**
